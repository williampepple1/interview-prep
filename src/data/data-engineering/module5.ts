# ETL Pipeline Design

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines are the foundation of data integration, moving data from source systems to target destinations.

## ETL Process Overview
- **Extract**: Pull data from source systems (databases, APIs, files)
- **Transform**: Clean, validate, and restructure data
- **Load**: Insert data into target systems (warehouses, databases)

## Pipeline Design Principles
- **Modularity**: Break pipelines into reusable components
- **Scalability**: Design for growing data volumes
- **Reliability**: Handle failures and ensure data consistency
- **Monitoring**: Track pipeline performance and data quality
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear pipeline documentation

## Data Extraction Strategies
- **Full Load**: Extract all data from source systems
- **Incremental Load**: Extract only new or changed data
- **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Track and capture data changes
- **Real-time Extraction**: Stream data as it's generated
- **Batch Extraction**: Process data in scheduled batches

## Data Transformation Techniques
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, handle missing values
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data quality and consistency
- **Data Enrichment**: Add additional context and information
- **Data Aggregation**: Summarize data for analysis
- **Data Formatting**: Standardize data formats and structures

## Loading Strategies
- **Full Refresh**: Replace all data in target system
- **Incremental Update**: Add new data without replacing existing
- **Upsert**: Update existing records or insert new ones
- **Append Only**: Add new records without modifying existing
- **Partitioned Loading**: Load data into specific partitions

- **Scheduler**: Monitors DAGs and triggers task execution
- **Executor**: Executes tasks (Sequential, Local, Celery, Kubernetes)
- **Metadata Database**: Stores DAG definitions and execution history
- **Workers**: Execute tasks in distributed environments

## DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)
- **Nodes**: Individual tasks in the workflow
- **Edges**: Dependencies between tasks
- **Scheduling**: Time-based or event-based triggers
- **Retries**: Automatic retry mechanisms for failed tasks
- **Backfilling**: Re-running workflows for historical periods

## Operators
- **BashOperator**: Execute bash commands
- **PythonOperator**: Execute Python functions
- **EmailOperator**: Send email notifications
- **HttpOperator**: Make HTTP requests
- **Custom Operators**: Build specialized operators

## Best Practices
- **Idempotency**: Ensure tasks can run multiple times safely
- **Atomicity**: Make tasks atomic and independent
- **Monitoring**: Set up proper logging and alerting
- **Testing**: Test DAGs before deployment
- **Documentation**: Document DAG purpose and dependencies
